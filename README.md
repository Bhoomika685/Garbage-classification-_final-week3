This project is submitted as part of the *Week 3 submission* for the AI & ML Internship by Edunet Foundation, Shell, and AICTE.



## 📌 Project Objective

The goal of this project is to develop a deep learning model using *Transfer Learning* techniques to classify different types of garbage (e.g., plastic, metal, paper, etc.) into appropriate categories. This contributes to *automated waste management systems* that can sort waste efficiently and reduce environmental impact.



## 🧠 Key Concepts Used
- *Transfer Learning* using pre-trained CNN models (e.g., MobileNetV2)
- *Image Preprocessing* with TensorFlow & Keras
- *Garbage classification dataset* (custom or Kaggle-based)
- *Model evaluation* using accuracy and loss curves


## 🔧 Technologies & Libraries
- Python
- Google Colab
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Matplotlib, NumPy
- Machine Learning & Deep Learning concepts



## 📁 Dataset Info
- The dataset includes images of garbage belonging to multiple categories like *cardboard, glass, metal, paper, plastic, and trash*.
- Images are resized and normalized before training.



## 📈 Results Summary
- Training and validation accuracy achieved is around *__%*.
- The model successfully classifies garbage categories and can be used for further deployment in IoT-based smart bin systems.

📌 (You can update with your model accuracy if known.)
